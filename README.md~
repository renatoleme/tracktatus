# Tracktatus.js

> Random Tractatus aphorisms.

Thanks to Pierre Bellon, there exists a .json file of  Wittgenstein's  Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus available on GitHub: https://github.com/pbellon/tractatus-tree. Starting from that, I made a simple script that gets a random aphorism and exhibt it as a comprehensive HTML div. It's a simple plugin made by and for Tractatus enthusiasts.
